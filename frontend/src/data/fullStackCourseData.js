  faqs: [
    {
      q: "I have zero coding experience. Can I really do this?",
      a: "Yes. 40% of our current cohort started with zero experience. The first 2 weeks are foundational. By week 3, you're building real projects. What matters isn't where you start—it's your commitment. If you can dedicate 30-40 hours/week for 12 weeks, you'll graduate job-ready."
    },
    {
      q: "Is 12 weeks enough to learn full-stack development?",
      a: "It's enough to become dangerous, not everything. Here's the honest answer: You'll build 15+ real projects, understand core concepts deeply, and have a portfolio that gets interviews. After you get hired, you'll spend years mastering advanced patterns. Our job is to get you to the starting line."
    },
    {
      q: "How much does it cost?",
      a: "₹99,999 for the full 12-week program (paid upfront) or ₹35,000 × 3 months. We offer scholarships for women and students from tier-2/3 cities (20% off). If you don't land a job within 3 months, 50% refund."
    },
    {
      q: "Will I get a job guarantee?",
      a: "We don't guarantee jobs. We guarantee job readiness. By the end, you'll have 15+ production projects, mock interview practice, and direct introductions to 100+ companies. 87% of graduates land jobs within 6 weeks. If you don't get an offer within 3 months, we refund 50% of your tuition."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I have a job and limited time?",
      a: "This program requires 30-40 hours/week. If you're working full-time, you can take 18 weeks instead (same price, half-pace). But honestly, most working professionals struggle unless they are highly disciplined. We recommend taking a month off or switching to a part-time role."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the schedule?",
      a: "Monday-Friday: 6 PM - 8 PM live sessions (optional but recommended). Self-paced projects during the day (you control when/how). Weekend 1:1 mentorship (book your slot). It's not a rigid bootcamp—it's structured flexibility."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I'm not good at coding?",
      a: "'Good at coding' is subjective. What matters is persistence. Your mentor will keep pushing until you understand. We track progress weekly. If you're falling behind, we add extra support sessions at no extra cost."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the success rate for freshers vs experienced people?",
      a: "Freshers: 89% placement rate, 6-week average time to job. Career Switchers: 82%, 7-week average. Already Working: 75%, 8-week average (because working people sometimes search less aggressively)."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I get a certificate?",
      a: "Two certificates: 1. Training Completion: Proves you completed a rigorous mentor-led program. 2. Internship Experience: Proof of 4 weeks real-project work under mentor guidance. Both are LinkedIn-worthy and company-recognized."
    },
    {
      q: "What tech stack will I learn?",
      a: "MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with modern tools like Tailwind and Vercel. We choose these because React has 43% market share and Node.js is the most flexible backend."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I learn different tech (Python, Django, etc.)?",
      a: "This program is specifically React/Node.js. If you want a different stack, talk to us. We might customize (costs extra, slower timeline), but MERN is our flagship."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I don't like my mentor?",
      a: "You can switch mentors for free once. We want you working with someone whose style clicks with you."
    },
    {
      q: "Is this program beginner-friendly?",
      a: "Yes, with a caveat. 'Beginner-friendly' doesn't mean 'easy.' We don't assume prior knowledge, but we expect hard work. The drop-out rate is 8% (people who quit mid-program)."
    },
    {
      q: "Can international students join?",
      a: "Yes, for ₹150,000 (higher because of timezone coordination). Only accepting 2-3 international students per cohort. Sessions are recorded for asynchronous viewing."
    }
